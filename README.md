# Project Overview: Automated Digital Forensics Tool

---

### Project Title:

Automated Digital Forensics Tool for Automated Incident Investigation

### Team Members:

5 Members (Senior CS Students, Cybersecurity Major)

### Objective:

The goal of this project is to develop automated digital forensics Framework that automates the investigation process for security incidents. The project will be delivered in stages, beginning with memory forensics, followed by Registry investigation and event logs investigation. In parallel with these stages, a visualization and GUI will be developed to enhance the usability of the tool. A future enhancement will include AI-powered PCAP file analysis for network forensics. This tool will reduce manual efforts, speed up investigations, and increase accuracy, particularly in large-scale environments.

### Core Features & Development Stages:

1. *phase one: Automated Memory Forensics Anomaly Detection*
    - Description: The first stage of the project will focus on analyzing system memory dumps to uncover evidence of malicious activity. Automation will be utilized to speed up the investigation process by analyzing the processes for malicious executables and dlls, check the commands ran, and internet connections.
    - Technologies Used:
        - Volatility for memory dump analysis.
        - scripting language yet to decide.
    - Importance: Memory forensics is essential for identifying sophisticated malware that operates entirely in memory, bypassing traditional file-based detection techniques. Automating the detection process improves efficiency and accuracy.
2. *Phase Two: Registry Forensics Automation*
    - Description: This stage focuses on the automation of registry analysis to detect traces of malicious activity and system manipulation. The automated system will parse and analyze key registry hives to identify indicators of persistence mechanisms, unauthorized changes to critical system configurations, and other suspicious modifications. Key areas of focus will include analyzing the "Run" keys, looking for auto-start extensibility points (ASEPs), investigating recently accessed files, and searching for evidence of privilege escalation attempts.
    - Technologies Used:
    Registry Analysis Tools: Utilization of tools like RegRipper or RECmd to parse registry files and extract valuable information.
    Scripting Language: TBD, with a preference for a language that integrates well with the chosen registry tools (e.g., Python or PowerShell).
    - Importance: Registry forensics is vital for uncovering evidence of persistence and misconfigurations that attackers often exploit to maintain access. Automating registry analysis streamlines the detection of registry-based persistence techniques and speeds up the identification of potential indicators of compromise (IOCs), helping responders act faster.
3. *Phase Three: Event Logs Investigation Automation*
    - Description: This phase automates the examination of event logs, specifically focusing on system, security, and application logs. Automation will parse and filter through large volumes of logs to identify anomalous activities, such as unauthorized logins, privilege escalation attempts, suspicious account creation, and notable patterns of service start/stop events. By automating this process, the project aims to reduce the manual effort required to pinpoint meaningful security events and highlight potential security incidents.
    - Technologies Used:
    Log Analysis Tools: Integration of tools like EvtxECmd or LogParser to process and filter event logs.
    Scripting Language: TBD, with Python or PowerShell being strong candidates due to their flexibility in handling log data.
    - Importance: Event logs are crucial for tracking and correlating actions taken on a system, offering insights into an attackerâ€™s behavior and methods. By automating event log analysis, security teams can quickly identify suspicious patterns or attack indicators, significantly enhancing the speed and effectiveness of the incident response process.
4. *Parallel Stage: Visualization and GUI Development*
    - Description: Alongside the first and second stages, a user-friendly GUI and visualization tools will be developed. This interface will present forensic results clearly, utilizing visual representations such as event timelines and anomaly heat maps.
    - Technologies Used:
        - Matplotlib or D3.js for data visualization.
        - Tkinter or PyQt for GUI development yet to decide.
    - Importance: A well-designed GUI and visual representations of forensic data will make the tool accessible and intuitive for users, allowing investigators to navigate large datasets and quickly grasp critical insights.
5. **Machine Learning for Event Prioritization**
    - **Description**: This module will apply machine learning to rank incidents based on severity, focusing on patterns in registry changes, memory anomalies, and event logs. Each event will be scored for risk, guiding investigators to prioritize critical incidents.
    - **Technologies Used**:
        - Machine Learning frameworks (e.g., *scikit-learn*, *TensorFlow*, or *PyTorch*).
    - **Importance**: Prioritizing incidents automatically will accelerate investigations, allowing teams to address the highest-risk threats more efficiently.

### Technological Stack:

- *Digital Forensics Tools*:
    - Volatility (memory forensics).
    - Registry Explorer and Reg Ripper.
    - Wireshark or Scapy (PCAP analysis, future feature).
    - Windows Event Log Parsing (for endpoint data).
- *Programming Languages*:
    - Python (primary language for AI and forensic tool development).
    - JavaScript (for visualization tools like D3.js).
- *Visualization & Reporting Tools*:
    - Matplotlib / D3.js (data visualizations).
    - Tkinter or PyQt (for GUI development).

### Conclusion:

This AI-powered digital forensics tool will streamline the incident investigation process, automating critical tasks and providing actionable insights faster than manual analysis. With its modular approach, starting with memory forensics, followed by endpoint forensics, and combined with an intuitive GUI, the tool will serve as a powerful solution for forensic investigators and cybersecurity teams. The future addition of network forensics (PCAP analysis) will provide a comprehensive, end-to-end investigation tool that covers system, endpoint, and network data.
